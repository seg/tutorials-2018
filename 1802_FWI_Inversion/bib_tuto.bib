	Abstract = {
            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

	abstract = {Domain specific languages (DSL) have been used in a variety of fields to express complex scientific problems in a concise manner and provide automated performance optimization for a range of computational architectures. As such DSLs provide a powerful mechanism to speed up scientific Python computation that goes beyond traditional vectorization and pre-compilation approaches, while allowing domain scientists to build applications within the comforts of the Python software ecosystem. In this paper we present Devito, a new finite difference DSL that provides optimized stencil computation from high-level problem specifications based on symbolic Python expressions. We demonstrate Devito{\textquoteright}s symbolic API and performance advantages over traditional Python acceleration methods before highlighting its use in the scientific context of seismic inversion problems.},

@article{haber10TRemp,
	Abstract = {Often, parameter estimation problems of parameter-dependent PDEs involve multiple right-hand sides. The computational cost and memory requirements of such problems increase linearly with the number of right-hand sides. For many applications this is the main bottleneck of the computation. In this paper we show that problems with multiple right-hand sides can be reformulated as stochastic programming problems by combining the right-hand sides into a few {\quotedblbase}simultaneous{\textquotedblright} sources. This effectively reduces the cost of the forward problem and results in problems that are much cheaper to solve. We discuss two solution methodologies: namely sample average approximation and stochastic approximation. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach we present two model problems, direct current resistivity and seismic tomography.},
